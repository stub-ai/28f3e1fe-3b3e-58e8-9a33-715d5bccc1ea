When I first open the app, everything works fine with the screen in portrait mode. However, after rotating the screen to landscape and then back to portrait, the screen display gets distorted and the view narrows. Texts and images that appeared normal at first become distorted after rotating the screen to landscape and then back to portrait. Can you provide a code solution to fix this screen rotation issue in Objective-C?","md5":"5ebc3fbc3c35ace8a3ced2426f1a83a9"}]}
